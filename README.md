# Automated_Document_Processing_-_Presentation_Generation
Developed Google Apps Script solutions for automating content extraction from Google Docs to Google Sheets, and subsequently generating dynamic presentations in Google Slides. The scripts accurately parse custom placeholders within documents, populate structured spreadsheet templates, and produce fully customized Google Slides presentations using pre-defined slide layouts. Key features include handling rich-text formatting, dynamic slide duplication, placeholder substitution, and advanced text parsing with styling markers (e.g., bold and bullet points). These automations streamlined content creation workflows, reduced manual labor, improved accuracy, and significantly enhanced team productivity and collaboration.
